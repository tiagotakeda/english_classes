## More details about Every, Each and All…

### -- EVERY --

**Every** refers to all members of a group though considered individually. It can be used to talk about three or more people/things.

#### Every + singular noun

The noun that comes after Every is in singular form.

* I have visited **every country** in South America (we do NOT say: every countries)
* I can understand **every word** our teacher says. (we do NOT say: every words)

Note, when you use `every + noun` as a subject, it uses a **singular verb** (verb + s)

* **Every** day **is** a chance to learn something new.
* **Every** child **needs** love and care.
* **Every** house on the street **looks** the same.

#### Every + number + plural noun

**Every** can be followed by a **plural noun** when there is a number before that noun. This is common with periods of time or things at regular intervals.

* He gets his head shaved **every three weeks**.
* You need to take a break **every two hours**.

We can also use **every** without a number and a **singular noun** to refer to regular intervals:

* He plays football **every Saturday**.
* She goes to the gym **every day**.

### -- EACH --

**Each** refers to all members of a group though we think of them more one by one (individually). **Each** can be used to talk about two or more people/things.

#### Each + singular countable noun

You use a singular (countable) noun after the word **Each**.

* Make sure you enjoy **each moment** in your life.
* They play the national anthem of **each country** before the game begins.
* Live **each day** as if it were your last.

#### Each + one

**One** can be used to replace the singular countable noun if it has already been mentioned.

* A: What do I have to do with these antique vases? 
B: You need to take each one outof the box very carefully. (each one = each vase)

#### Each of + determiner + plural noun

Each can be followed by a determiner (my, his, the, etc.) and a plural noun.

* I kiss **each of my children** before they go to bed at night.
* The teacher had a little kid holding on to **each of her hands**.
* **Each of the guides** has a different group to show around the museum.

Notice how after `each of` the verb is usually in singular form though when speaking informally, you will sometimes hear a plural verb used.

* Each of my students **has** a different assignment to complete. (correct use)
* Each of my students **have** a different assignment to complete. (informal use)

#### Each of + pronoun (you/us/them)

We can only use the pronouns you/us/them after **each of**.

* He gave **each of us** a small gift at the end of the course.
* You need to wash **each of them** before use.
* **Each of you** needs to complete the assignment individually.

Again the verb following each of + pronoun should be in the singular form.

#### Each as a pronoun

**Each** can be used by itself (without a noun) as a pronoun.

* When the students finished to course, **each** was given a certificate. (Each = each of the students)

Though it is more common to use `each one` instead of `each` by itself.

* …each one was given a certificate.

#### Noun/Pronoun + each

**Each** can be used after the noun (or pronoun) it describes.

* The parents gave their children some pocket money. To avoid problems, they each received the same amount.

#### Auxiliary Verb/To Be + each

**Each** can be used after an **auxiliary verb** or the verbs `Are` and `Were`.

* I have four books to sell and they **are each** worth around five dollars.
* They **have each** been told their responsibilities.

#### Object + each

Instead of going before/after the subject, **EACH** can appear after the object.
This is common when the noun object refers to an amount, how many of something there is or when giving a price.

* My paintings are worth $100 **each** (= Each of my paintings are worth $100)
* I gave my children **each** an ice cream.

### -- ALL --

**All** refers to the **total** number of people or things of a group. They are considered as a group and not individually. There are minimum three things in the group.

#### All + noun

We can use **All** with a plural noun to make a generalization about an entire group of something.

* **All** sharks are dangerous.
* **All** elephants are slow.

#### All + of + determiner + noun

The noun can be singular, plural or an uncountable noun. These nouns can also be replaced by pronouns.

* You need to read **all of the book**.
* **All of the pages** are yellow and old.
* **All of the fish** in the pond have died.
* You need to remove **all of them** before they start to smell bad.

Note that `All of + singular noun` is not common and `Whole` or `Entire` are used instead of all of.

* You need to read the **whole** book (= all of the book)

We can also remove **OF** before the determiner + noun (but we must use **OF** before a pronoun)

* You need to read **all the book**.
* **All the pages** are yellow and old.

#### Pronoun + all

Sometimes you can place `All` after a **pronoun** to emphasize that every single one of that group is included.

* **We all** hope you get better soon.
* I hope **you all** have a great time.
* I have made **us all** some sandwiches.

#### Compare All vs. Each

`All` refers to the entire group as a whole. `Each` refers to the individual members of the group.

* I say goodbye to **each** student as they leave the room.
* I say goodbye to all of the students as they leave the room.

#### Compare All vs. Every

I simple way to remember is that `All` is with a `plural noun + plural verb` while `Every` is with a `singular noun + singular verb`. `Every` can also suggest “without exception”.

* **All** students **receive** a certificate.
* **Every** student **receives** a certificate.

We can use **All** with uncountable nouns (and not **Every**).

* I like **all** music (NOT every music)
* Place **all** luggage on the counter. (NOT every luggage)
