# Private Classes Resources and Materials

This is my repository of materials, including grammatical articles, exercises, etc, so it gets easier if I need to give private classes to anyone.

## Updates

* jan-14-2020 - I've already spent some days organizing this repo and already have written some articles of the `basic` repo.
