## All / Every / Each

### The difference between All, Every, and Each - Quick Explanation

`All` means the total number of people or things considered as a group.
`Every` means all members of a group considered individually.
`Each` means all members of a group considered individually though we think of them more one by one.

### What is the difference between Each and Every?

Both *Each* and *Every* generally have the same meaning. They refer to all members of a group considered individually. **Every** is closer in meaning to **All** than **Each** is.

* **Every** book in the course must be read before the end of the semester.
* **Each** book in the course must be read before the end of the semester.

We use **Each** when we think of them more as one by one. There is a little less emphasis on the individual with **Every** when comparing it to **Each**.

However notice that every cannot be used when referring to two things and is not common with small numbers.

* Every (one) of my parents (incorrect)
* **Each** of my parents (correct)

We **CANNOT** use *Each* with the words **Almost** or **Nearly**. Here we use **Every**.

* Almost each car pollutes the atmosphere. (incorrect)
* Almost every car pollutes the atmosphere. (correct)
