## Adjectives Eding in EN and ING

There are many adjectives that we have in English that end in **-ED** or **-ING**.
Yes, that's correct, they are not only endings that we use for verbs!

An adjective that ends in **-ING** is used to describe: the **characteristic** of a person, a thing or a situation.

An adjective that ends in **-ED** is used to describe: a **feeling** (or how a person feels) or an **emotion**. It is used to describe a temporary thing. Since only people (and some animals) have feelings, -ed adjectives cannot be used to describe an object or situation.

Compare the difference:

* My girlfriend is **bored**. - (My girlfriend feels bored)
* My girlfriend is **boring**. - (My girlfriend is a boring person)

You can use these adjectives to describe people or situations but be careful that you are using the correct adjective. For example, there is a big difference in meaning between:

* I am **confused**. - (I don't understand something)
* I am **confusing**. - (I will cause you to be confused)

Note that the sentences below are to highlight the difference between the two types of adjectives. They are NOT common to do or say because they sound repetitive.

* I was **shocked** by how **shocking** the accident was last night.
* They were **frightened** by the **frightening** roller-coaster ride!
* I am **annoyed** by how **annoying** that person in front of us is.
* Sally was **confused** by the **confusing** street signs in the city.

### More Examples

* This grammar lesson is **boring**. I am **bored** reading all about these grammar rules.

* Public toilets are usually **disgusting**. I am **disgusted** by the smell in some of them.
* Your speech was very **inspiring**. I am now **inspired** to do wonderful things with my* life.
