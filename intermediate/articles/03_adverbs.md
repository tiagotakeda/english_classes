# Grammar

## Adverbs

**Adverbs** describe verbs (actions). They give more detail about the action.

* My cat eats **slowly**.

> *Slowly* is an adverb since it describes the way my cat eats.
> How does my cat eat? Slowly.

> Adverbs will generally answer the question 'How'.

Some **adverbs** are used to modify an **adjective**.

Adverbs that do this are: *very*, *extremely*, *really*, *totally*, absolutely*, *quite*, *fairly*, *well*. These are normally placed before the adjective.

* It was **very** hot yesterday.
* He is **totally** crazy.


### Types of Adverbs

There are many types of adverbs, such as:

`Adverbs of Frequency` - always, sometimes, never, once a week, hourly, etc.

`Adverbs of Manner` - carefully, slowly, loudly

`Adverbs of Time` - tomorrow, now, this year, next week, soon, then

`Adverbs of Place/Location` - here, there, above, everywhere

`Adverbs of Degree` - very, extremely, rather, almost, nearly, too, quite

`Adverbs of Quantity` - a few, a lot, much

`Adverbs of Attitude` - fortunately, apparently, clearly

### Adverbs Word Order

**Adverbs** are usually placed after the verb:

* He speaks **clearly**.

When there is an object, the **adverb** is usually placed after the verb + object:

* I put the vase **carefully** on the table.

However, adverbs are never positioned between the verb and the object.

* I read the book **quickly**. - (Correct)
* I read **quickly** the book. - (Incorrect)

Sometimes adverbs are placed at the beginning of a clause.

* **Quickly**, I changed my opinion.

There are exceptions these rules such as Adverbs of indefinite frequency that go before the verb. See each section we have about adverbs for more details and exceptions.
