## Present Perfect

The Present Perfect Tense is formed using the following structure:

**Affirmative**: `Subject` + `Have / Has` + `Past Participle`

**Negative**: `Subject` + `Haven't / Hasn't` + `Past Participle`

**Question**: `Have / Has` + `Subject` + `Past Participle`

### When do we use the Present Perfect Tense?

**1. Unspecified point in the past**

* I have been to Spain three times.
(At some unspecified time in the past, I went to Spain).

Compare with the simple past:

* I went to Spain three times in 2005.
(specified time in the past - the year 2005)

**2. An action that occurred in the past, but has a result in the present (now)**

* We can't find our luggage. Have you seen it?
(The luggage was lost in the past, do you know where it is now?)

**3. Talking about general experiences (ever, never)**

It usually refers to an event happening at some moment in your life.

* Has she ever tried Chilean wine before? (in her life)
* I've never eaten monkey brains before. (in my life)

**4. Events that recently occurred (just)**

* Do you want to go to a restaurant with me?
No, thanks. I've just eaten lunch. (I recently ate lunch.)

**5. Events that have not occurred up to now (yet)**

* Are Carlos and Rodrigo here? No, they haven't arrived yet. (they're still not here now)

**6. Events that occurred before you expected (already)**

* I've already graduated from University. (I expected to graduate at a later date.)

**7. Events that began in the past and haven't changed (for, since)**

* Mike has worked at Woodward for 3 years.
(Mike started working at Woodward 3 years ago and he still works there now.)
* Julie has worked at Woodward since September last year.
(Julie began working at Woodward in September of last year, and that hasn't changed- she still works here now.)
