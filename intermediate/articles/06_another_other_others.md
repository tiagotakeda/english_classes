## Another / Other / Others

### Quick Summary: What is the difference between another and other?
A simple rule to help you remember the difference between another and other is:

`another` + `singular noun`
`other` + `plural noun`
`others` (a pronoun to replace) `other + plural noun`

##### Examples

* I need **another** cup. (cup is singular so we use another)
* I need **other** cups. (cup is plural so we use other)
* I need **others**. (refers to other cups)

### When to use ANOTHER

**Another** means:

* one more, an additional, an extra
* a different one; an alternative one

**Another** is a determiner (and a qualifier) that goes before a singular countable noun or a pronoun.

### Another + Singular Countable noun

**Another** can be followed by a singular countable noun.

* He has bought **another** motorbike.
* Would you like **another** cup of coffee?
* Don’t worry about the rain. We can go **another** day.
* I think you should paint it **another** color.
* We are having **another** baby.

#### Another + One

**Another** can be placed before “one” when the meaning is clear from the text before it.

* I have already eaten two sandwiches though now I want **another** one. (= an additional sandwich)
* A: You can borrow more of these books if you like. B: Ok, I’ll take **another** one. (= another book, one more book)

#### Another as a pronoun

Sometimes **another** is used as a pronoun.

* That piece of cake was tasty. I think I’ll have **another**. (another = one more piece of cake)
* I don’t like this room. Let’s ask for **another**. (another = another room)

> **Note:** you can also say: “I think I’ll have another one.” and “Let’s ask for another one.”

#### Another + number + plural noun

**Another** can be used before a plural noun when there is a number before that noun or before phrases such as a couple of, a few etc.

* In another 20 years my laptop is going to be obsolete.
* I like this city so much that I’m going to spend another three days here.
* We need another three teachers before classes begin.
* He was given another couple of months to finish the sculpture.

> **Remember:** another is ONE word not two words (an other is incorrect)

### When to use OTHER

**Other** is a determiner that goes before plural countable nouns, uncountable nouns or a pronoun.

#### Other + Plural Countable Noun

**Other** can be followed by a plural countable noun.

* We have **other** styles if you are interested.
* Have you got any **other** dresses, or are these the only ones?
* Some days are sunny though **other** days can be very rainy.
* I have invited some **other** people.
* I can’t help you because I’m busy with **other** things.

#### Other + Ones

**Other** can be placed before the pronoun “ones” when the meaning is clear from the text before it.

* We don’t need those books, we need **other** ones. (= different books)
* A: You can borrow my books if you like. B: Thanks, but I need **other** ones. (= other books)

> **Note:** you can say other one when it refers to wanting the alternative.

* I don't want this one, I want the **other** one.

#### Others as a pronoun

**Others** replaces “other ones” or "other + plural noun".
Only **others** can be used as a pronoun and not other.

* I don’t like these postcards. Let’s ask for others. (others = other postcards)
* Some of the presidents arrived on Monday. Others arrived the following day.

#### Others - the others

Often “(the) others” refers to “(the) other people”.

* He has no interest in helping others. (= in helping other people)
* What are the others doing tonight?

### What is the difference between other and others?
**Other** is followed by a noun or a pronoun
**Others** is a pronoun and is NOT followed by a noun.

* These shoes are too small. Do you have any other shoes?
* These shoes are too small. Do you have any others? (no noun after others)
