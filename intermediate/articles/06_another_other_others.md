## Another / Other / Others

### Quick Summary: What is the difference between another and other?
A simple rule to help you remember the difference between another and other is:

`another` + `singular noun`
`other` + `plural noun`
`others` (a pronoun to replace) `other + plural noun`

##### Examples

* I need another cup. (cup is singular so we use another)
* I need other cups. (cup is plural so we use other)
* I need others. (refers to other cups)
