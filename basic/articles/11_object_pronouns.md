## Object Pronouns

The seven basic pronouns have one form when they are used as subjects and another form when they are used as objects.

**Subjects** are what the sentence is about. (See more about <a href="2_present_simple">Subject Pronouns</a>)
**Objects** are what is affected by the action of the subject.

* I like orange juice. (`I` is the subject).
* I read books. (`Books` is the object as it is receiving the action).

Object pronouns are used instead of nouns, usually because we already know what the object is. It makes the sentence easier to read and understand, avoiding repetition. We normally use object pronouns after a verb or a preposition.
