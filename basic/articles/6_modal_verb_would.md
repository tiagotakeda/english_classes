## Modal Verb - Would

**Would** is a modal verb that is often used in conditional sentences with a clause beginning with "If..." but it can also be used in the following situations:

**1. Used as a polite invitation or to offer.**

   * Would you like to go to the movies with me tonight?
   * Would you like some more tea?
   * I would be happy to help you with preparation for your exam.

When someone asks a question to invite you or offer you something using Would, the response can be:
