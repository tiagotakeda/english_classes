## Demonstrative Pronouns / Demonstrative Adjectives

This, That, These, Those are called demonstratives and they are used to show the relative distance between the speaker and the noun.

1. Objects that are **NEAR** to the person who is speaking:
   * `This` is my car. (*Singular*)
   * `These` are our children. (*Plural*)

2. Objects that are **FAR** from the person who is speaking:
   * `That` is our house. (*Singular*)
   * `Those` are my shoes. (*Plural*)

You can also use Demonstrative Pronouns by themselves:

Did you do **that**?
I'd like to buy **these**?
Which of **those** would you like?

**NOTE:** The difference between *Demonstrative Pronouns* and *Demonstrative Adjectives* is basically that the *Demonstrative Adjective* comes before a noun.

* This party is boring. (singular)
* That city is busy. (singular)
