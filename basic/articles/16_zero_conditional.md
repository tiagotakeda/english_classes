## Zero Conditional

Zero conditionals are used for facts that are usually true and do not change.
It refers to a general situation that always happen (for example in the rules of a game) if a condition is met. The condition always has the same result.

The basic structure of a Zero Condictional is: The first part is in the present simple tense and the second part is in the present simple tense too.

##### Examples

* If you put water in the freezer, it becomes ice.
* If you stand in the rain, you get wet.
* If you heat ice, it melts.

You can see in the examples about the condition always has the same result.

Notice how we use a comma after the first present simple tense clause.

We can also reverse the order and use:

* You get wet if you stand in the rain.
* Ice melts if you heat it.
* I can't sleep if I drink coffee at night.
* Plants die if you don't water them.

Notice how the comma is not necessary with this word order.

#### IF / WHEN
We can often use **WHEN** instead of **IF** and it has the same meaning.

* **If** you keep milk in the fridge, it lasts longer.
* **When** you keep milk in the fridge, it lasts longer.

The result is always the same. One thing (a condition) always leads to another (a result.
Another example:

* **If** you leave ice in the sun, it melts.
* **When** you leave ice in the sun, it melts.

There is no difference in meaning when you change IF for WHEN in zero conditional sentences.
