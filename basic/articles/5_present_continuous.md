### Present Contonuous (Progressive)

#### Present X Progressive

The most clear difference between *Present* and *Progressive is the verb conjugation.

* In the *Present Tense* we **do not** add anything to the verb **base form**.

* In the *Progressive Tense* we have to **add** **-ING** in the end fo the verb.

We use *Present Continuous* basically for actions that are happening at this moment.

#### Examples

* Sarah is changing her clothes right now.
* Her boyfriend is waiting for her.
* We are learning the progressive tense in English.
* It is snowing at the moment.
* The economy is growing at an exponential rate.
* The children are sleeping so please be quiet.
* Alfredo is studying a lot for his exam.
* I'm reading a great book. <code>(Not necessary right at this moment)</code>
* We are planning a trip to Jamaica.
