## Adverbs of Frequency

We use some adverbs to describe how frequently we do an activity.

These are called **adverbs of frequency** and include:

### INDEFINITE Frequency

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Frequency</th>
            <th>Adverb of Frequency</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>100%</td>
            <td><center>always</td>
            <td>I <strong>always</strong> go to bed before 11 p.m.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>90%</td>
            <td><center>usually</td>
            <td>I <strong>usually</strong> have cereal for breakfast.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>80%</td>
            <td><center>normally / generally</td>
            <td>I <strong>normally</strong> go to the gym.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>70%</td>
            <td><center>often / frequently</td>
            <td>I <strong>normally</strong> surf the internet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>50%</td>
            <td><center>sometimes</td>
            <td>I <strong>sometimes</strong> forget my wife's birthday.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>30%</td>
            <td><center>occasionally</td>
            <td>I <strong>occasionally</strong> eat junk food.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>10%</td>
            <td><center>seldom</td>
            <td>I <strong>seldom</strong> read the newspaper.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>5%</td>
            <td><center>hardly ever / rarely</td>
            <td>I <strong>hardly ever</strong> drink alcohol.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>0%</td>
            <td><center>never</td>
            <td>I <strong>never</strong> swim in the sea.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Position of the *Adverb* in a Sentence

An adverb of frequency goes before a main verb (except with To Be).

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Subject + adverb + main verb</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> I <strong>always</strong> remember to do my homework. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> He <strong>normally</strong> gets good marks in exams. </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

An adverb of frequency goes **after** the verb **To Be**.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Subject + to be + adverb</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> They are <strong>never</strong> pleased to see me. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> She isn't <strong>usually</strong> bad tempered. </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<br/>

When we use an auxiliary verb (*have*, *will*, *must*, *might*, *could*, *would*, *can*, etc.), the adverb is placed between the auxiliary and the main verb. This is also true for *To Be*.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Subject + auxiliary + adverb + main verb</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> She can <strong>sometimes</strong> beat me in a race. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> I would <strong>hardly ever</strong> be unkind to someone. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> They might <strong>never</strong> see each other again. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> They could <strong>occasionally</strong> be heard laughing. </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

We can also use the following adverbs at the start of a sentence:

Usually, normally, often, frequently, sometimes, occasionally

* `Occasionally`, I like to eat Thai food.

BUT we **cannot** use the following at the beginning of a sentence:

*Always*, *seldom*, *rarely*, *hardly*, *ever*, *never*.

We use *hardly ever* and *never* with positive, not negative verbs:

* She `hardly ever` comes to my parties.
* They `never` say 'thank you'.

We use *ever* in questions and negative statements:

* Have you `ever` been to New Zealand?
* I haven't `ever` been to Switzerland. (The same as 'I have never been Switzerland').

### DEFINITE Frequency

We can also use the following expressions when we want to be more specific about the frequency:

* every day
* once a month
* twice a year
* four times a day
* every other week
* daily
* monthly

These are also known as **Adverbs of DEFINITE frequency** as the exact frequency is specified.
