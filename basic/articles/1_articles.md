## The Indefinite Articles - A / AN

**A** is used when the next word begins with a consonant sound (b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k etc).

* a book
* a table
* a clock
* a university (because the beginning of university sounds like YOU-niversity)

**AN** is used when the next word begins with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u).

* an apple
* an elephant
* an umbrella
* an hour (because the H is silent)*
