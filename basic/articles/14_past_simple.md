## Simple Past Tense

In general, the *Past Tense* is used to talk about something that started and finished at a definite time in the past.

The main rule is that for every verb in English, there is only one form of it in the past tense.

>The exception is the Past tense of To Be, which has two forms: was and were

This is totally different from other languages such as Spanish, French, Italian etc. where you change the verb ending for every subject.

For example: The past tense of the verb want is wanted.

Wanted is used as the past tense for all subjects/pronouns.

* I wanted
* You wanted
* He wanted
* She wanted
* It wanted
* We wanted
* They wanted

So you just have to learn one word to be able to use it in the past tense. In this case we just needed to learn the one word wanted which can be used for all subjects (or people).

#### Regular Verbs

To change a regular verb into its past tense form, we normally add –ED to the end of the verb.

* play - played
* cook - cooked
* rain - rained
* wait - waited

There are some exceptions with a slight change in spelling which you can see below on the `Spelling -ED Ending Rules`

#### Examples

* Last night I **played** my guitar loudly and the neighbors **complained**.
* She **kissed** me on the cheek.
* It **rained** yesterday.
* Angela **watched** TV all night.
* John **wanted** to go to the museum.

#### Negative sentences in the Past Tense

We use `didn't` (`did not`) to make a negative sentence in the past tense.

> This is for regular AND irregular verbs in English.
> Exception is To Be and Modal Verbs such as Can

Compare the following examples:

* *Present*: They **don't** live in Canada.
* *Past*: They **didn't** live in Canada.

* *Present*: He **doesn't** speak Japanese.
* *Past*: He **didn't** speak Japanese.

#### Questions in the Past Tense

We use `did` to make a question in the past tense.

> This is for regular AND irregular verbs in English.
> Exception is To Be and Modal Verbs such as Can

Compare the following examples:

* *Present*: Do they live in France?
* *Past*: Did they live in France?
* *Present*: Does he live in Italy?
* *Past*: Did he live in Italy?

We can also use a question word (Who, What, Why etc.) before DID to ask for more information.

* Did you study? – Yes, I did.
* When did you study? – I studied last night.
* Where did you study? – I studied at the library.

##### Short Answers

As is the case with any verb tense in English, it is generally possible to give short answers to a question. This is certainly the case for questions in the *Past Tense*.

> If the question commences with one of the traditional question words such as WHO, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, WHAT, WHICH or HOW, it requires a more detailed answer and it is not possible to give a short answer.

Remember that if the question starts with DID, you can give a short answer using DID. It is not necessary to use the main verb in the answer.
