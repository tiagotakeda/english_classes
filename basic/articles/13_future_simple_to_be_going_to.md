## Futur Simple (To Be + going to)

A very confusing concept is when to use **WILL** and when to use **BE GOING TO** when we refer the future.

Both refer to the future and there is a slight difference between the two though in most cases they can be used interchangeably with no difference in meaning. Even if you misuse them, a native speaker is going to understand you without any problems.
