## Futur Simple (To Be + going to)

The structure **BE GOING TO** is normally used to indicate the future but with some type of connection to the present. We use it in the following situations:

**1. When we have already decided or we INTEND to do something in the future. (Prior Plan)**

* The decision has been made before the moment of speaking.

  * They're going to retire to the beach - in fact they have already bought a little beach house.
  * I'm going to accept the job offer.

**2. When there are definite signs that something is going to happen. (Evidence)**

* Something is likely to happen based on the evidence or experience you have.

  * I think it is going to rain - I just felt a drop.
  * I don't feel well. I think I'm going to throw up. (throw up = vomit)

**3. When something is about to happen:**

* Get back! The bomb is going to explode

##### BE GOING TO vs WILL

A very confusing concept is when to use **WILL** and when to use **BE GOING TO** when we refer the future.

Both refer to the future and there is a slight difference between the two though in most cases they can be used interchangeably with no difference in meaning. Even if you misuse them, a native speaker is going to understand you without any problems.

In this article we are going to discuss only the **BE GOING TO** case, the **WILL** future will have a specific article later on intermediate level.

If you feel really excited at this moment and really want to know the difference, even though I do not recommend to do this at this at this moment, check out this <a href="https://www.grammar.cl/Notes/Future_Will_vs_Going.htm">link</a>
