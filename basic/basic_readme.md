### Simple Present Tense

The simple present tense in English is used to describe an action that is regular, true or normal.

We use the Present Tense:

1. **For repeated or regular actions in the present time period.**
    * I **take** the train to the office.
    * The train to Berlin **leaves** every hour.
    * John **sleeps** eight hours every night during the week.

2. **For facts.**
    * The president of The USA **lives** in The White House.
    * A dog **has** four legs.
    * We **come** from Switzerland.

3. **For habits.**
    * I **get up** early every day.
    * Carol **brushes** her teeth twice a day.
    * They **travel** to their country house every weekend.

4. **For things that are always / usually true.**
    * It **rains** a lot in winter.
    * The Queen of England **lives** in Buckingham Palace.
    * They **speak** English at work.

#### Base from vs Infinitive Form

When the verb is not conjugated in any form we indicate that in English by using the work **TO** before the verb. For example:

* To work
* To study
* To play

If we are **only** talking about the verb, we can use its *Base Form*, for example:

* work
* study
* play

#### Conjugation and Spelling

We form the *Present Tense* simply by using the base form of the verb

Un general, in the third person we add **'S'** in the end of the verb.

| <center>Subject</center> | <center>Verb</center> | <center>Rest</center> of the sentence |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <center>I / You / We / They</center> | <center>speak</center> | <center>english at home</center> |
| <center>He / She / It</center> | <center>speaks</center> | <center>english at home</center> |

The spelling of the verb in the third person  differs depending on the ending of that verb:

1. For verbs that end in **-O, -CH, -SH, -SS, -X** or **-Z** we add **-ES** in the third person.
    * go - goes
    * catch - catches
    * wash - washes
    * kiss - kisses
    * fix - fixes
    * buzz - buzzes

2. For verbs that end int a **consonant + Y**, we remove the **Y** and add **-IES**.
    * marry - marries
    * study - studies
    * carry - carries
    * worry - worries

**NOTE:** For verbs that end in a **vowel + Y**, we just add **-S**.
* play - plays
* enjoy - enjoys
* say - says

### Negative Form

To make a negative sentence in English we normally use **Don't** or **Doesn't** with all verbs EXCEPT **To Be** and **Modal verbs** (can, might, should, etc.).

1. For **I, You, We** and **They** subject pronouns.
    * Affirmative: You speak French.
    * Negative: You **don't** speak French.


2. For **He, She, It** subject pronouns.
    * Affirmative: He speaks German.
    * Negative: He **doesn't** speak German.

**NOTE:** The letter **-S** at the end of the verb (because of the third person) disappears in the negative form.


**More Examples**:
* You **don't** speak Arabic.
* John **doesn't** speak Italian.
* We **don't** have time for a rest.
* It **doesn't** move.
* They **don't** want to go to the party.
* She **doesn't** like fish.

##### Negative Contractions

DON'T = DO NOT
DOESN'T = DOES NOT

I **don't** like meat = I **do not** like meat.

### Question Form

To make a question in the *Simple Present Tense* we usually use **Do** or **Does**, it has no translation in portuguese, but it is essential to show that we are making a question.

1. We will ALWAYS use **Do** when the subject is **I**, **You**, **We** or **They**.

    * Affirmative: You speak English.
    * Question: **Do** you speak English?

2. We will ALWAYS use **Does** when the subject is **He**, **She** or **It**.

    * Affirmative: She speaks French.
    * Question: Does she speak french?

**NOTE:** The letter **-S** at the end of the verb (because of the third person) disappears in the question form.
